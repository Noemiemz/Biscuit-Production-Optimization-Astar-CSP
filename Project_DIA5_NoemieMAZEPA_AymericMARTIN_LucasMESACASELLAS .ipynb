        "The problem is that a biscuit factory wants to produce several types of Christmas biscuits on the same roll of dough. Each type of biscuits has a different size and a different price and the objective of this problem is to maximize the production of those biscuits and therefore ensure the best profit for the factory by finding an optimized solution for the biscuit placement on the dough roll.  \n",

It’s a practical choice for tackling real-world challenges where finding a good solution quickly is crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "CSP, on the other hand, is fascinating due to its structured approach to constraints. Since this problem is heavily constraint-based, studying CSP allows us to dive into how rules and restrictions can be managed effectively. Techniques like constraint propagation and heuristics make CSP both methodical and efficient, which is why it seemed like a great fit for exploring this type of problem.\n",

        "#### **Challenges**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **A\\*:**\n",
        "1. The main challenge we encountered was that the solution returned first by the A* algorithm isn't necessarily the best solution. For a long time we were stuck with the final value 661 and no matter what we changed in the algorithm, this value stayed the same. It took us quite some time to realize, when talking to some other groups, that the best solution isn't the first one and that we should visit every single branch entirely and keep in memory to return the best solution. The reason why, the first solution isn't optimal like it is supposed to is the end goal. The problem with this problem is that the end goal isn't a specific configuration: it's just that we reached the end of the dough. This way, the \"optimal solution\" is only the one where we reach the end of the dough the fastest.\n",
        "**->** What we did was that we expand all the nodes possible and look at all the different solutions possible and only keep the best one.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. After we realized that, we tried to compile the search until the frontier was empty and all the solutions were found to get the best. However, there was a second problem that made the expansion and visit of the nodes would never finish or at least take over 10 minutes before it was interrupted. This is because to avoid visiting the same nodes several times, we used a set to keep in memory each of the visited nodes to ensure we don't visit them twice. We took inspiraion from the 8-square puzzle from Homework 1 where some configurations repeated themselves sometimes in the tree. However, it took us a long time to realize that no combination could repeat itself in different branches with this specific problem so this set was definitely unuseful.\n",
        "\n",
        "**->** Instead we chose to keep in memory the best price for a given position and each time we visit a node, if for the same position, the value of the current node is lesser, we don't expand it because it could never be the best solution going forward. This makes the search go much faster and allows us to find the best solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **CSP :**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initial Challenge: The main problem with the CSP approach was that it searches for the first valid solution, not the best. Unlike A*, CSP does not naturally evaluate and compare all possible solutions to find the optimal one. Instead, it stops as soon as it finds a configuration that satisfies all constraints. This can result in a suboptimal total value.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Optimization Challenge: Since this was a limitation, we had to see whether the problem setup regarding CSP can be modified to return better solutions. The standard CSP framework is very good at quickly returning valid solutions. However, in order for it to optimize the sum of values, there would need to be major restructuring of the approach, which may involve adding additional constraints or running multiple runs with different setups. This will actually defeat the core mechanism of the CSP in satisfying constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Memory Management: Unlike A*, CSP does not inherently remember visited nodes or require a significant amount of memory to handle the frontier or heuristic evaluations. However, making sure the constraints were efficient at every step required an overall careful tracking of biscuit positions and defect thresholds to avoid unnecessary recomputation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Key Learning : CSP was much quicker in execution simply because it is lean and its goal is to reach a solution, not to explore all configurations or produce the \"best\" solution, according to some value. Hence, it is intrinsically fit for problems where it is acceptable to have any valid solution given, rather than optimization problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Reflections**:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **A\\*:**\n",
        "1. Advantages: A* is great for figuring out the most profitable way to produce biscuits by balancing production value and penalties. It’s perfect for identifying solutions that maximize profits while minimizing waste or defects. In biscuit production, this means A* can help find the best combination of steps to produce high-quality biscuits with fewer issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Disadvantages: The downside of A* is that it can be slow. Since it looks at all possible solutions to find the best one, it takes more time to run, especially with complex setups. For biscuit production, this might not work well when quick decisions are needed, like adapting to sudden changes in demand or production issues. Plus, A* uses a lot of memory, so managing that carefully is key to keeping things running smoothly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Conclusion: A* is a great choice when the focus is on getting the best results, like maximizing profits and minimizing penalties, even if it takes a bit longer. It’s especially useful for planning and optimizing processes where quality and efficiency are more important than speed. To make A* work well, it’s important to think about how you’re exploring solutions and to keep an eye on memory usage so it doesn’t slow down too much.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **CSP :**\n",
        "1. Efficiency vs. Optimality: CSP is great at quickly finding a solution that meets the constraints, often with very little computation time. However, this speed comes with a tradeoff—it doesn’t always find the best solution. For example, if the goal is to maximize or minimize a value (like the biscuit value here), CSP might settle for a valid solution that isn’t the most optimal. This highlights its strength in solving problems fast but also shows its limitations when optimization is key.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Scalability: CSP’s simple and focused approach makes it highly scalable for problems with clear rules and limited possibilities. It works especially well when the constraints are strict, and any valid solution will do. However, as the constraints or the need for optimization get more complex, CSP might need significant adjustments, which could make it harder to use effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Applicability to real-world problems: CSP fits perfectly for real-world tasks like scheduling, resource allocation, or layout planning—situations where the main goal is just to meet specific constraints. But it’s less suited for problems where you need to explore or refine multiple solutions to find the best one. CSP is a solid first step for quickly finding a feasible solution, but for fine-tuning or optimization, it’s often best paired with other techniques like A*.\n"
